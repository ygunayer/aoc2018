# Advent of Code 2018
Good ol' Advent of Code, solved with Rust.

## Prerequisites
- Rust

## Running
### Development Mode
Simply run `cargo run <day> <solution>` e.g.

```bash
$ cargo run 1 1
```

### Production Mode
I don't know why you'd actually want to do this, but just build the project in optimized mode and run the binary.

```bash
$ cargo build
$ ./target/release/aoc2018 1 1
```
